# food-basket

App that shows location of shelters and places in need of food, so restaurants can know where they can send leftover food (mitigate restaurant food waste during pandemic).
Shelters, food pantries, etc in need of food can input their location on the app to be “put on the map”.
Restaurants nearby will get notifications that a place nearby needs food, and then they potentially can ship out food to them.
They have an incentive to do so because they will get points every time they donate food and customers can see that they are helping out the community → potentially bring in more customers!
